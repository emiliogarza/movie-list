# Movie List
Loved making this project, my favorite aspect was how it has a feature to pin movies that your interested in watching. I know any movie lover has a watched list, so providing that functionality is a useful thing given the site's subject. 

## Pleased with
I'm most pleased with that I was able to use simple RxJs Subjects to allow the various components to subscribe to the state of the form and the results, that way I added have to pass anything around with @Input. Feels more scalable that way.

Also, I really enjoyed using GraphQL to easily tailor the properties I would like displayed on the Search Results.

## Future Features?
Given more time, I think some improvements would be:
1. Better Page URLs for better SEO benefits, formulate titles in URLs.
2. Create a Reviews Feature, where you can comment how you felt about the movie. Would build a Netlify Function and Supabase Database.
3. Have a page with latest movies being featured
4. Work on some of the UI to make it cleaner and more attractive.
